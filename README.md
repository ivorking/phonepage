## Phonepage Practice

### Requirements
* Use front end technologies to build a data driven component of the website
* HTML – Your markup must be readable, semantic and concise
* CSS – You can use whichever pre-processor you like
* JS – Create a succinct JavaScript solution
* Use any frameworks you like, but ensure there is reason and purpose behind your choice(s)
* Create a build process
* Consider future reuse and maintenance of code
* Provide documentation for both build process and at code level via comments (where needed)
* Page must display in Chrome, IE11 and Firefox
* On selection of a colour or capacity the image will change and the prices will update

### Notes on solution
* This solution could be created as a React component, for integration into a larger website (this would be the recommended approach)
* However, for the sake of speed and simplicity, single page JS, HTML, CSS, jQuery solution selected
* See console log and in-code comments for details of the solution
